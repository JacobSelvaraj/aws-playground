Identify the key components of your DynamoDB system, such as the DynamoDB table, the application code that interacts with the table, and the network infrastructure that connects them.
Define the goals and objectives of the Chaos testing, such as identifying potential blackhole scenarios and testing the system's resilience to them.
Identify the potential failure scenarios that could lead to a blackhole scenario, such as network partitioning, node failures, or data corruption.
Use Chaos Engineering tools like Gremlin to simulate these failure scenarios and observe how the system responds.
Verify that the system is able to recover from the simulated failures and that data is still accessible and readable after the failure scenarios are resolved.
Analyze the results of the Chaos testing and identify areas for improvement. This may include making changes to the network infrastructure, modifying the application code to handle failures more effectively, or implementing retry logic in the system.
Iterate the Chaos testing process to ensure that the system remains resilient to potential blackhole scenarios over time.
