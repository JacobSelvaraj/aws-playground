Single-Table Design Pattern:
In a single-table design pattern, you can store related items in the same table to simplify querying and improve performance. For example, let's say you have an e-commerce application that stores customer orders. You could create a single table called "Orders" with the partition key as "OrderID" and the sort key as "CustomerID". This way, you can quickly retrieve all orders for a particular customer or all orders for a specific order ID.

Adjacency List Design Pattern:
In an adjacency list design pattern, you can represent hierarchical relationships between items in a table. For example, let's say you have a social media application that stores data about users and their friends. You could create a single table called "Users" with the partition key as "UserID" and the sort key as "FriendID". Each item in the table would represent a user-friend relationship, with the "UserID" attribute representing the user and the "FriendID" attribute representing the friend.

Composite Keys Design Pattern:
In a composite keys design pattern, you can use a combination of partition and sort keys to efficiently query data based on specific criteria. For example, let's say you have a music streaming application that stores data about songs, artists, and albums. You could create a single table called "Music" with the partition key as "ArtistID" and the sort key as "SongID". This way, you can quickly retrieve all songs by a particular artist or all songs on a specific album.

GSI Overloading Design Pattern:
In a GSI overloading design pattern, you can use a single Global Secondary Index to support multiple query patterns. For example, let's say you have a product catalog application that stores data about products, categories, and brands. You could create a single table called "Products" with the partition key as "ProductID" and the sort key as "CategoryID". You could then create a Global Secondary Index called "BrandCategoryIndex" with the partition key as "BrandID" and the sort key as "CategoryID". This way, you can efficiently query products by brand, category, or both.

Time-Series Data Design Pattern:
In a time-series data design pattern, you can organize data based on a timestamp to enable efficient querying and analysis. For example, let's say you have a weather monitoring application that stores data about temperature and humidity readings. You could create a single table called "WeatherData" with the partition key as "SensorID" and the sort key as "Timestamp". This way, you can quickly retrieve data for a particular sensor or all data for a specific time period.
