In Datadog, moving rollup refers to a method used for aggregating time series data points over a specified time window. The moving rollup method calculates an aggregated value for each data point in the window, which "moves" along with the time series. This helps to reduce noise and provide smoother, more meaningful metrics.

In the context of "moving rollup 15 method max," the expression means the following:

"Moving rollup 15": This indicates that the moving rollup is calculated over a 15-minute window. As time progresses, the window slides, and the rollup calculation is updated accordingly.

"Method max": This denotes that the aggregation method used for the moving rollup is the maximum value. In this case, the maximum value within each 15-minute window is chosen as the aggregated value for that window.

So, "moving rollup 15 method max" means calculating the maximum value within each 15-minute time window as the aggregated data point. This can be useful for monitoring metrics where you want to track the highest value in a given period, such as the maximum resource usage, peak response times, or maximum error counts.
